## About Me
Hello, my name is Shannon Kuhn. I live in North Versailles, a suburb of Pittsburgh, PA, with my husband and my two dogs. I received my bachelor's in creative writing from Seton Hill University in 2014. I enjoy cooking, curling up in a blanket burrito of comfort, and reading/watching all things silly and/or fictional. I just recently started working from home as an editor for Pearson, the largest education company in the world. This is a very exciting change for me, because my two greatest passions are education and the power of the written word.
## Past Coding Experience
In my professional experience, I have used authoring and assessment engines like Arbortext and ITS that consist of simplified and intuitive coding templates for building print and online materials. Basically, my understanding of code is very surface level, with a lot of the real action happening behind the scenes in my work. I am familiar with different formatting tags and I understand the basics of html and CSS, but only so much as I generally know what they look like and what the functions accomplish. I have never written code for a website or anything from scratch beyond a basic html webpage in high school 12 years ago. 
## Career Goals
1. Six months: Graduate with an MA in Mass Communications with a specialization in Digital Strategy. 
2. Two years: Earn a position of regular employment at Pearson at the end of my two-year limited term contract.
3. Five years: Specialize in special populations and engage in cross-departmental projects focused on the accessiblity and accommodation offerings available through Pearson for students with disadvantages.
4. Ten years: Eventually lead and then manage a hybrid team that is solely focused on leveraging evolving technologies and marketing strategies to produce and promote educational products for special populations.
